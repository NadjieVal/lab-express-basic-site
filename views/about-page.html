    <h1>The Culture of Guadeloupe</h1>
    <p class="p-1">
      The islands of Guadeloupe have been home to many cultures since their
      earliest settlements. Arawak culture gave way to the Caribs, and the
      French introduced African and Asian workers. The English also tried to
      gain control of the islands, which completed Guadeloupe's unique fusion of
      influences that are still strongly felt today.
    </p>

    <p class="p-2">
      Much of Guadeloupe's culture can be found in its arts. The region has been
      home to many writers, artists, dancers, and musicians who express the
      varied cultural background of the islanders with depth and style.
      Islanders also dress in many traditional fashions that express their
      culture. However, Guadeloupe is also known for its food and language.

    <h2>Literature and the Arts</h2>
    <p class="p-3">
      One of Guadeloupe's most famous writers is not even known by his true
      name. He wrote under the pseudonym of Saint-John Perse. Born Alexis Leger,
      he studied in Bordeaux and wrote in many styles before completing his work
      of poetry that earned him the Nobel Prize for Literature. In fact, his
      1924 poem "Anabase" was translated by T.S. Eliot. <br /><br />Other
      Guadeloupean authors include Simone Shwartz-Bart, Ernest Pepin, Gis√®le
      Pineau, Maryse Conde, Max Rippon, Luc Hubert Sejore. Guadeloupe's writers
      have mastered forms as varied as daily news reporting to cultural epics
      and have brought the island literary recognition.<br /><br />
      Painting is also important on Guadeloupe, where colors of sea, sky, and
      sand can all inspire. In fact, museums across the islands showcase
      paintings from local artists. Most regional styles are done in charcoal
      and oil paints, but crafts are important, too. Islanders have found ways
      to use nearly everything available within their natural surroundings, and
      they even blow colored glass from Guadeloupe's multi-hued sand.
